A Phonegap-BackboneJS-Backstack-RequireJS Boilerplate
===========

This boilerplate is originally created by pwalczyszyn and adjusted by me.

Libraries included:
- Phonegap(cordova) 2.5.0
- RequireJS 2.0.6
- BackboneJS v1.0.0 - http://backbonejs.org/
- Backstack 2.0(created by pwalczyszyn) - https://github.com/pwalczyszyn/backstack
This is for switching views within Backbone. Does a better job than $.mobile
- Underscore.js 1.4.4
- Textjs v2.0.3 - https://github.com/requirejs/text
- domReady - https://github.com/requirejs/domReady

Note: the boilerplate could certainly use some performance improvements and does
certainly contain some bugs but I hope it will be developed further.
